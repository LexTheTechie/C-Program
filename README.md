# C-Program

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  The goal of the project here was to create an item-tracking program using C++ and Python code. The program allows the user to complete three main tasks based upon a  processed 	text file detailing the items purchased throughout the day. The user is able to produce a list of all items purchased along with the number of purchases each item has, lookup a 	 specific item that was purchased and recieve the number of times that item was purchased, and produce a histogram representing the items purchased and the number of times the 		item was purchased within a given day. 
	
What did you do particularly well?
	Something that I did particularly well was create the display menu and results view in C++. I wanted to make sure my menu options were as specific as possible so that thhe user 	 would without a doubt know which results to expect when choosing an option. I also wanted to make my results view clear by specifying that user option two produced the number of 	 times the item was purchased and also wanted to make sure that the histogram was clearly understood by creating a colored histogram using "boxes" as my symbol. 
	
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
	I could enhance my code within my python code by printing the list in C++ in alphabetical order. This would ensure that the code is not printing duplicate items with incorrect 	purchase numbers to the naked eye. I could also change my python function for option two in the user menu to produce the item searched and the number of items purchased to 	   	 ensure that the number of purchases correlates to the item selected. Both changes would make the code more efficient. 
	
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
	The most challenging pieces of code for me to write was the code relating to the frequency data file and the histogram. I knew what i wanted and needed to do to make it work but 	it just took me a while to get on a roll with it. I overcame the difficulties by doing outside research about reading from a data file and how to create a histogram that is 	     readable and stands out. A couple of resources that I will be adding to my support network are StackOverFlow and W3Schools. They helped alot with basic things that you sometimes 	 overlook when you're stuck looking at the bigger picture.
	
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
	Almost all skills from this project can be transferrable to other projects or course work going forward. However, the most important would be polymorphism and file manipulation. 	The polymorphism between C++ and Python in this instance can be transferred between any two languages but especially C++ and Java because the two languages are very similar. The 	file manipulation can be transferrable to any other coding task in any language as one will more than likely have to receive information froma  file with big coding tasks. 
	
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
	I made the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by keeping it as simple as possible. Except for the histogram code in C++, most of the code is simple and to the point. 	 The python code includes functions that came with the code that were left to test that the base code is working.The remainder of the functions in the python code have titles 		 	 that give insight to what the fucntion does and consistent variables to alter the code if needed to perform any other tasks regarding the list. In the C++ code, I used single 		line comments where variables and cout executions were used that may have been confusing to the reader along with using the proper whitespace and formatting.
